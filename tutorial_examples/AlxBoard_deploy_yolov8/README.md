## Ⅱ. Configure . NET 

&emsp;    . NET is a free cross platform open source developer platform for building multiple applications. The following will demonstrate how AIxBoard can install the. NET environment on Ubuntu 20.04, supporting the. NET Core 2.0-3.1 series and. NET 5-8 series. If your AIxBoard is using another Linux system, you can refer to [Install .NET on Linux distributions - .NET | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/install/linux)

### 1. Add Microsoft Package Repository

&emsp;    The installation using APT can be completed through several commands. Before installing. NET, please run the following command to add the Microsoft package signing key to the trusted key list and add the package repository.

&emsp;    Open the terminal and run the following command:

```bash
wget https://packages.microsoft.com/config/ubuntu/20.04/packages-microsoft-prod.deb -O packages-microsoft-prod.deb
sudo dpkg -i packages-microsoft-prod.deb
rm packages-microsoft-prod.deb
```

&emsp;    The following figure shows the output of the console after entering the above command:

<div align=center><span><img src="https://s2.loli.net/2023/08/01/2PGvUJbrR68axWt.png" height=300/></span></div>

### 2. Install SDK

&emsp;    The. NET SDK allows you to develop applications through. NET. If you install the. NET SDK, you do not need to install the corresponding runtime. To install the. NET SDK, run the following command:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y dotnet-sdk-3.1
```

&emsp;    The following figure shows the output of the console after entering the above command:

<div align=center><span><img src="https://s2.loli.net/2023/08/08/tKY3oASu4Tf2dib.png" height=300/></span></div>


### 3. Test installation

&emsp;    You can check the SDK version and runtime version through the command line.

```
dotnet --list-sdks
dotnet --list-runtimes
```

&emsp;    The following figure shows the output of the console after entering the above command:

<div align=center><span><img src="https://s2.loli.net/2023/08/08/DQnli6Z3xOpVYvh.png" height=300/></span></div>

### 4. Test Console Project

&emsp;    In the Linux environment, we can create and compile projects using the **dotnet** command. The project creation command is:

```
dotnet new <project_type> -o <project name>
```

&emsp;    Here we create a simple test console project:

```
dotnet new console -o test_net6.0
cd test_net6.0
dotnet run
```

&emsp;    The following figure shows the output of the console and the file status of the project folder after entering the test command. The C # project will automatically create a **Program. cs ** program file, which contains the main function of the program runtime entry. At the same time, it will also create a **\*. csproj ** file, which is responsible for specifying some configurations in the project compilation.

<div align=center><span><img src="https://s2.loli.net/2023/08/01/4WjvIPOZFHsnihQ.png" height=300/><img src="https://s2.loli.net/2023/08/01/FSkNPvLpVt1qbGX.png" height=100/></span></div>

&emsp;    The above are the configuration steps for the. NET environment. If your environment does not match this article, you can obtain more installation steps through [.NET documentation | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/).

## Ⅲ. Install OpenVINO Runtime

&emsp;    OpenVINO™  have two installation methods: OpenVINO Runtime and OpenVINO Development Tools. The OpenVINO Runtime contains a core library for running model deployment inference on processor devices. OpenVINO Development Tools is a set of tools used to process OpenVINO and OpenVINO models, including model optimizer, OpenVINO runtime, model downloader, and more. We only need to install OpenVINO Runtime here.

### 1. Download OpenVINO Runtime

&emsp;   Visit the [Download the Intel Distribution of OpenVINO Toolkit](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/openvino-toolkit/download.html?ENVIRONMENT=DEV_TOOLS&OP_SYSTEM=WINDOWS&VERSION=v_2023_0_1&DISTRIBUTION=PIP) page and follow the process below to select the corresponding installation options. On the download page, as our device is using **Ubuntu 20.04 **, download according to the specified compiled version.

<div align=center><span><img src="https://s2.loli.net/2023/08/01/BJ9SaVZmz8TUx4l.jpg" height=300/><img src="https://s2.loli.net/2023/08/01/GJbCHiSTtwdj791.jpg" height=200/></span></div>

### 2. Unzip installation package

&emsp;    The OpenVINO Runtime we downloaded is essentially a C++dependency package, so we placed it in our system directory so that dependencies can be obtained during compilation based on the set system variables. First, create a folder under the system folder:

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /opt/intel
```

&emsp;    Then extract the installation files we downloaded and move them to the specified folder:

```bash
tar -xvzf l_openvino_toolkit_ubuntu20_2023.0.1.11005.fa1c41994f3_x86_64.tgz
sudo mv l_openvino_toolkit_ubuntu20_2023.0.1.11005.fa1c41994f3_x86_64 /opt/intel/openvino_2022.3.0
```

### 3. Installation dependencies

&emsp;    Next, we need to install the dependencies required by the OpenVINO Runtime. Enter the following command from the command line:

```bash
cd /opt/intel/openvino_2022.3.0/
sudo -E ./install_dependencies/install_openvino_dependencies.sh
```

<div align=center><span><img src="https://s2.loli.net/2023/08/01/B9ehCPf8KvXURFg.png" height=300/></span></div>

### 4. Configure environment variables

&emsp;    After the installation is completed, we need to configure the environment variables to ensure that the system can obtain the corresponding files when calling. Enter the following command from the command line:

```bash
source /opt/intel/openvino_2022.3.0/setupvars.sh
```

&emsp;    The above are the configuration steps for the OpenVINO Runtime environment. If your environment does not match this article, you can obtain more installation steps through [Install OpenVINO™ Runtime — OpenVINO™ documentation — Version(2023.0)](https://docs.openvino.ai/2023.0/openvino_docs_install_guides_install_runtime.html).

## Ⅳ. Configuration AlxBoard_deploy_yolov8 

&emsp;    The code used in the project has been placed in the GitHub repository [AlxBoard_deploy_yolov8](https://github.com/guojin-yan/OpenVINOSharp/blob/openvinosharp3.0/tutorial_examples/AlxBoard_deploy_yolov8/Program.cs), and you can download and use it according to your situation. Below, I will build the AlxBoard step by step from scratch_ Deploy_ Yolov8 project.

### 1. Create AlxBoard_deploy_yolov8 

&emsp;    In this project, we need to use OpenCvSharp, which currently supports up to. NET Core 3.1 on the Ubutun platform. Therefore, we will create a project for. NET Core 3.1 and use Terminal to enter the following command to create and open the project file:

```shell
dotnet new console --framework "netcoreapp3.1" -o AlxBoard_deploy_yolov8
cd AlxBoard_deploy_yolov8
```

<div align=center><span><img src="https://s2.loli.net/2023/08/08/Pln5v6NmeWpg4JG.png" height=200/></span></div>

&emsp;    创建完项目后，将[AlxBoard_deploy_yolov8](https://github.com/guojin-yan/OpenVINOSharp/blob/openvinosharp3.0/tutorial_examples/AlxBoard_deploy_yolov8/Program.cs)的代码内容替换到创建的项目中的**Program.cs**文件中.

### 2. Add OpenVINO™ C# API Dependency

&emsp;    Due to the fact that OpenVINO™ C# API is currently in the development phase and has not yet created a Linux version of NuGet Package, it is necessary to use it as a project reference by downloading the project source code.

- **Download source code**

  Download the project source code through Git, create a new Terminal, and enter the following command to clone the remote repository and place the project on AlxBoard_ Deploy_ Under the same level directory as yolov8.

  ```
  git clone https://github.com/guojin-yan/OpenVINOSharp.git
  cd OpenVINOSharp
  ```

  The project directory for this article is:

  ```
  Program--
  		|-AlxBoard_deploy_yolov8
  		|-OpenVINO-CSharp-API
  ```

- **Modify OpenVINO ™ Dependency**

  Due to the OpenVINO™ dependency of the project source code being different from the settings in this article, it is necessary to modify the path of the OpenVINO™ dependency, mainly by modifying the ``OpenVINO™ C# API/src/OpenVINO™ C# API/native_methods/ov_base.cs``. The modifications are as follows:

  ```
  private const string dll_extern = "./openvino2023.0/openvino_c.dll";
  ---Modify to--->
  private const string dll_extern = "libopenvino_c.so";
  ```

- **Add Project Dependency**

  Enter the following command in Terminal to add OpenVINO™ C# API to AlxBoard_ Deploy_ Yolov8 project reference.

  ```
  dotnet add reference ./../OpenVINO-CSharp-API/src/OpenVINOSharp/OpenVINOSharp.csproj
  ```

- **Add environment variables**

  This project requires calling the OpenVINO dynamic link library, so it is necessary to add the OpenVINO dynamic link library path in the current environment:

  ```
  export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/intel/openvino_2023.0/runtime/lib/intel64
  ```

### 3. add OpenCvSharp

- **Install NuGet Package**

  OpenCvSharp can be installed through NuGet Package by simply entering the following command in Terminal:

  ```
  dotnet add package OpenCvSharp4_.runtime.ubuntu.20.04-x64
  dotnet add package OpenCvSharp4
  ```

- **Add environment variables**

  Add the following path to the environment variable:

  ```shell
  export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/ygj/Program/OpenVINOSharp/tutorial_examples/AlxBoard_deploy_yolov8/bin/Debug/netcoreapp3.1/runtimes/ubuntu.20.04-x64/native
  ```

  ``/bin/Debug/netcoreapp3.1/runtimes/ubuntu.20.04-x64/native`` is AlxBoard_ Deploy_ The path generated after Yolov8 compilation contains the ``libOpenCvSharpExtern. so`` file, which mainly encapsulates various interfaces in OpenCV. You can also copy the file to the project running path. 

- **Detect ``libOpenCvSharpExtern`` dependency**

  Due to the fact that ``libOpenCvSharpExtern.so`` is a dynamic link library compiled in other environments, the local computer may lack corresponding dependencies, so it can be detected through the ``ldd``command.

  ```shell
  ldd libOpenCvSharpExtern.so
  ```

  

  <div align=center><span><img src="https://s2.loli.net/2023/08/08/wZbkAmeg9dIv6BT.png" height=200/></span></div>

  If there is no 'no found' in the output content, it indicates that there is no missing dependency. If there is, the missing dependency needs to be installed in order to function properly.

&emsp;    After adding project dependencies and NuGet Package, the configuration file content of the project is:

```properties
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">

  <ItemGroup>
    <ProjectReference Include="..\OpenVINOSharp\src\OpenVINOSharp\OpenVINOSharp.csproj" />
  </ItemGroup>

  <ItemGroup>
    <PackageReference Include="OpenCvSharp4" Version="4.8.0.20230708" />
    <PackageReference Include="OpenCvSharp4_.runtime.ubuntu.20.04-x64" Version="4.8.0.20230708" />
  </ItemGroup>

  <PropertyGroup>
    <OutputType>Exe</OutputType>
    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp3.1</TargetFramework>
  </PropertyGroup>

</Project>
```



## Ⅴ. Run AlxBoard_deploy_yolov8 Project

&emsp;    The models and files used in the project testing can be found in OpenVINO™ C# API, so we will test them using the models and files in the OpenVINO™ C# API repository.

&emsp;    To run through Dotnet, simply run the following command

```shell
dotnet run <args>
```

\<args>refers to the model prediction type, model path, and image file path parameters. The prediction type input includes four types: 'det', 'seg', 'pose', and 'cls'; The default inference device is set to 'AUTO', and for 'det' and 'seg' predictions,<path can be set_ To_ Label>Parameter. If set, the result will be plotted on the image. If not set, it will be printed through the console.

## Ⅵ. Model runtime

&emsp;    The AIxBoard development board is equipped with the Intel Celeron N5105 CPU and Intel 11th generation integrated graphics card. Here, a simple test was conducted on the inference performance of the CPU and GPU, mainly detecting the model inference time. Synchronous testing was conducted using Intel Phantom Canyon, and the test results are shown in the table

|   Device    | CPU: N5105 | GPU: Intel 11th 集显 | CPU: i7-1165G7 | GPU: lntel(R) Iris(R) Xe Graphics |
| :---------: | :--------: | :------------------: | :------------: | :-------------------------------: |
| Yolov8-det  |  586.3ms   |        83.1ms        |    127.1ms     |              19.5ms               |
| Yolov8-seg  |  795.6ms   |       112.5ms        |    140.1ms     |              25.0ms               |
| Yolov8-pose |  609.8ms   |        95.1ms        |    117.2ms     |              23.3ms               |
| Yolov8-cls  |   33.1ms   |        9.2ms         |     6.1ms      |               2.7ms               |

&emsp;    It can be seen that the Intel Celeron N5105 CPU has very powerful model inference performance, and paired with the Intel 11th generation integrated graphics card, it has increased the inference speed by about 6 times. For the Yolov8 model, the average processing speed can reach 10FPs. Compared to the inference speed of Phantom Canyon, the inference performance of the AIxBoard development board is about one-fifth of that, which is still very powerful compared to ordinary development boards.

## Ⅶ. Summarize

&emsp;    In this project, we successfully implemented the call to OpenVINO in the C # environment based on the Ubutton 20.04 system ™ Deploying a deep learning model has verified the feasibility of the OpenVINOSharp project in the Linux environment, which is of great significance for the future development of OpenVINOSharp in the Linux environment.

&emsp;    In addition, we also used OpenVINOSharp to test the model inference ability of the AIxBoard development board. For the Yolov8 model, the average processing speed can reach 10FPS, which has already reached a high inference speed for most current development boards. I will continue to use OpenVINOSharp to deploy more deep learning models on the AIxBoard development board in the future.
