## This is OpenVINO‚Ñ¢ C# API 3.0 version, which is still under construction and its features are not yet fully developed. If there are any issues during use, please feel free to contact me. If you are interested in this project, you can also join our development.ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞

## üìö What is OpenVINO‚Ñ¢ C# API ?

[OpenVINO‚Ñ¢](www.openvino.ai)  is an open-source toolkit for optimizing and deploying AI inference.

- Boost deep learning performance in computer vision, automatic speech recognition, natural language processing and other common tasks
- Use models trained with popular frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch and more
- Reduce resource demands and efficiently deploy on a range of Intel¬Æ platforms from edge to cloud

&emsp;    However, OpenVINO‚Ñ¢ No C# language interface provided, which is beneficial for using OpenVINO‚Ñ¢ in C#  bringing a lot of trouble, therefore based on OpenVINO‚Ñ¢ The tool kit has launched OpenVINO‚Ñ¢ C# API, aiming to drive OpenVINO‚Ñ¢ Application in the C # field. OpenVINO‚Ñ¢ C# API is based on OpenVINO‚Ñ¢ Development, supported platforms, and OpenVINO‚Ñ¢ Consistent, please refer to OpenVINO‚Ñ¢ for specific information.

&emsp;¬†   Currently, OpenVINO‚Ñ¢ C# API has been updated and iterated to version 3.0. Compared to the previous version, OpenVINO‚Ñ¢ C# API version 3.0 has undergone a significant update, replacing the original refactoring of the C++API with directly reading OpenVINO\‚Ñ¢  The official C API makes the application more flexible and supports a richer range of functions.

## ‚öô How to install OpenVINO‚Ñ¢ C# API?

The following article provides installation methods for OpenVINO‚Ñ¢ C# API on different platforms, which can be installed according to your own platform.

- [Windows](docs/en/windows_install.md)

- [Linux](docs/en/linux_install.md)

## üè∑How to use OpenVINO‚Ñ¢ C# API?

- **Quick start**
  - [Deploying the Yolov8 full series model using OpenVINO‚Ñ¢ C# API](demos/yolov8/README.md)
  
- **Simple usage**

If you don't know how to use it, simply understand the usage method through the following code.

```c#
using OpenVINO‚Ñ¢ C# API;
namespace test 
{
    internal class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Core core = new Core();
            Model model = core.read_model("./model.xml");
            CompiledModel compiled_model = core.compiled_model(model, "AUTO"); 
            InferRequest infer_request = compiled_model.create_infer_request(); 
            Tensor input_tensor = infer_request.get_tensor("images"); 
            infer_request.infer(); 
            Tensor output_tensor = infer_request.get_tensor("output0"); 
            core.free(); 
        }
    }
}
```

The classes and objects encapsulated in the project, such as Core, Model, Tensor, etc., are implemented by calling the C API interface and have unmanaged resources. They need to be handled by calling the **dispose() ** method, otherwise memory leakage may occur.
